Tkinter GUI Application Development HOTSHOT
####INSTRUCTOR EXPECTATIONS:

####GRADING POLICY:  
Your grade will be computed using the breakdown:
Tests                                40%
Github Projects                35%
Final Project                    10%
Final Exam                      15%
Your letter grade in the course is assigned as follows:
A>93,A->90,B+>87,B>83,B->80,C+>77,C>73,C->70,D+>68, D >= 65, F < 65.
Typically the 65 is hard and fast: that means you shouldn’t count on a 64 as passing.
####HOMEWORK: 
Lots of programming assignments posted on Github.

####LEARNING OUTCOMES: 
1. Students will learn how to design an object and when to use OOP.
2. Students will learn about inheritance.

If you are a student with a disability and wish to request accommodations, please contact Dr. Elmore at the Office of Special Academic Services located in Crandall Hall, or call (607) 871-2148. Any information regarding your disability will remain confidential. Many accommodations require early planning, therefore requests for accommodations should be made as early as possible. Any requests for accommodations will be reviewed in a timely manner to determine their appropriateness to this setting.  
Students who have been granted accommodations from Special Academic Services must present to me the appropriate documentation in writing in advance of the use of such accommodations.


####LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION:
I am happy to write letters of recommendation for students as long as you have earned at least a B in my course. It would be really helpful if we have talked outside of class. I will also need a list of the activities you have participated in, and an e-mail with an address to send the letter to. You will also need to waive your rights to read the letter.
